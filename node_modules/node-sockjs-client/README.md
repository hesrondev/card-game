# SockJS client for node

## status: production ready [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/humanchimp/node-sockjs-client.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/humanchimp/node-sockjs-client) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/humanchimp/node-sockjs-client/badge.png)](https://coveralls.io/r/humanchimp/node-sockjs-client)

It's a fork of the SockJS client library that doesn't rely on DOM primitives, while still retaining the same interface as the original, making it suitable as a drop-in replacement in code meant originally to run in the browser.  It uses websocket as its only transport for now.
